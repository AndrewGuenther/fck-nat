This means that the highest bandwidth that fck-nat can support (while remaining cost-effective) is 5Gbps. This is enough to cover a very broad set of use cases, but if you need additional bandwidth, you should use Managed NAT Gateway. If AWS were to lift the limit on internet egress bandwidth from EC2, you could cost-effectively operate fck-nat at speeds up to 25Gbps, but you wouldn't need Managed NAT Gateway then would you? fck-nat.</p> <p>Read more about EC2 bandwidth limits here</p> <p>Additionally, if you have an allergy to non-managed services, fck-nat may not be for you.
